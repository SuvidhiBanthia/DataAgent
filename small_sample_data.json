And the moisturizer is so lightweight, I can use it twice a day and it doesn't get greasy. In fact, I even use it as a primer before applying make-up. I am super happy with this purchase and I'll be returning for more.",

I'd already used their face moisturizer from the same range and it's the best moisturizer I've never used till date for my oily skin. So I decided to buy this body lotion and here's my experience-\n1. It spreads really easily if you compare to other body lotions like Chemist at play AHA lotion. That was the one I used before this one and I don't get what the brag is about.\n\n2. Gets absorbed super quickly, unlike those lotions which take up a lot of time and efforts to be rubbed in.\n\n3. Has a really mild citrusy fragrance and medium consistency. However, it won't work if you have super dry skin. If you're somebody like me who sweats a lot. It's a good option to consider.\n\n4. Keeps the skin hydrated for a considerable amount of time and with a more than a week's use, I can say my skin has restored the glow which was previously decreased after using that AHA body lotion. Keeps the skin smooth and soft.\n\nOverall, super satisfied. Keep up the good work Dot & Key. 👍",

I read here on reddit that they don’t display all their ingredients and that the marketing is shady 🤔\n\nBut the items in the pic worked for me pretty well I have been using them since 2 months maybe. Haven’t tried anything that sounds serious like vitamin ,c glycolic acid and retinol. I don’t have much knowledge on their usage and I have sensitive skin so didn’t try. \n\nThese actually did much better than what a dermatologist prescribed for me, aktisoft, and some medicated sunscreen sunshade I guess and dermadew facewash. I had small small bumps on my cheeks and very dull skin so I visited the doctor and used those for about 4-5 months. Did literally nothing or kind of made it worse. Then I stopped using all of them and applied nothing for a while. My face looked perfect when I did this. 😹😹\n \nThen I got the moisturiser used just that for sometime and these along with the dot and key facewash and occasionally sunscreen. Now I use all the 4 steps daily. They improved my face. I would not say perfect but there is a good glow that I’m observing. (Heard it from others as well)  Even when I don’t apply anything it’s still good. \n\nSo have any of you used their products? What was your experience?\n\n( i’m not endorsing this brand just a genuine question 🙂‍↔️)",
